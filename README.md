### Incomplete commit, because I won't have time to finish before a server outage. If you need the data, it's in data. I will create .sdf versions soon.

To run a model, use main.py. The parameters can be adjusted in this file. I will make these command line options.
ensemble.py / ranker.py can be used to rank embeddings.


I've rewritten the code as Python files, but I still need to do association_rules.ipynb
