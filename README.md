# Text2Mol

## Incomplete commit, because I won't have time to finish before a server outage. If you need the data, it's in Text2Mol_full_data.zip

To run a model, use main.py. The parameters can be adjusted in this file. I will make these command line options.
ensemble.py / ranker.py can be used to rank embeddings.


I've written the code as Python files, but I still need to do association_rules.ipynb

To use the data with main.py, you should rename the extracted folder as "data".
